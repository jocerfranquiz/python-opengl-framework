Try changing the point size specified in the main application. You may
even want to purposefully introduce errors in the shader code to learn
what error messages are displayed in each case. Some common errors
include

 - not including a semicolon at the end of a statement
 - using an int instead of a float
 - assigning the wrong data type to a variable (such as assigning a vec3 to the vec4 type variable gl _ Position)
 - using the wrong number of values in a vector
 - Try introducing each of the errors into your shader code one at a time, and
familiarize yourself with the corresponding error messages.
