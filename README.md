# python-opengl-framework

This is an implementation of an **OpenGL Graphics Framework with Python** for educational purposes. For the implementation 
we only need this four libraries:

 - [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org)
 - [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net)
 - [PyOpenGL-accelerate](https://pypi.org/project/PyOpenGL-accelerate/)
 - [Numpy](https://numpy.org)

All the modules and script are conformed to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide by using
 - [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
 - [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)
 - [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)

### Index
 - [sandbox](https://github.com/newpaxonian/python-opengl-framework/tree/main/sandbox): This folder contains the test scripts that are implemented in the book to learn and test the framework.
 - [exercises](https://github.com/newpaxonian/python-opengl-framework/tree/main/exercises): This folder contains exercises proposed for each chapter.
 - [core](https://github.com/newpaxonian/python-opengl-framework/tree/main/core): This folder contains the core of the framework.

## Notes:
 - The code is based in the book: * [Developing Graphics Frameworks with Python and OpenGL](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/48838).
by *Lee Stemkoski* and *Michael Pascale*.
 - Project's structure is based on the one proposed in the book, 
but with emphasis in applying *pythonic üêç style*, code coverage and, and usability
 - The code is not fully tested. Please report any issue you find.
 - Some classes and functions has been modified to improve performance and/or usability.
 - Repo's history has comments with references to the book's pages
 - The main class ```Base``` and file ```base.py``` has been refactored to ```Game``` and ```game.py``` (it's more intuitive this way)
 - The file ```openGLUtils.py``` has been refactored to ```opengl_utils.py```
 - Functions and variables in the book are refactored from ```camelCase``` to ```snake_case```
